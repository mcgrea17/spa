This app is a To Do list, to keep track what needs to be done and mark off when the task is complete.  Just type in the top line a new task and press enter.  The new task will be added to the bottom of the task list.  Once a task is complete check the box next to the task.  The task will be crossed off.  This was an excersize using javasccript representation of the todo tasks and produces an HTML representation using <li> tags, as well as taking in an HTML representation of the an event that fires from an HTML representation of
 the toggle checkbox and  performs an API request to toggle the value of the `done` field <li> tags.
